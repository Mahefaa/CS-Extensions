## Playlists

There are several versions of playlists that differ in the way they are grouped. As of January 30th, 2024, we have stopped distributing NSFW channels. For more information, please look at [this issue](https://github.com/iptv-org/iptv/issues/15723).

### Main playlist

This playlist includes all known channels available in this repository.

```
https://iptv-org.github.io/iptv/index.m3u
```
### Grouped by country

<details>
<summary>Expand</summary>
<br>

Playlist in which each channel has its _country_ as a group title:

```
https://iptv-org.github.io/iptv/index.country.m3u
```

Same thing, but split up into separate files:
